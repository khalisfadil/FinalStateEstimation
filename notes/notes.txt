    - does keypoints and const_frame is different?
    - grid sampling provide initialized frame and keypoints.
    - initializeFrame has sub_sample_frame >> output >> downsampling of given input frame.
    - grid_sampling, copy the input frame and do sub_sample_frame, move(transform) downsampled frame into keypoints.
    - NOTE: grid_sampling can be optimized. redundancies operations.
    - initializeFrame has undo the motion distortion. it does shuffling of the points inside its frame.
    - keypoints is a frame that has undergoes second downsampling operations.
    - keypoints has undergoes motion undistortion. timestamp change? lookslike it retain its original timestamp
    - TODO: dataalingment, make sure the IMU data is inside the lidar frame.
    - I have calculated that every lidar frame, we have maximum of 5 IMU measurement.
    - stop at step 34 in icp.

    - I have add subsampling outlier removal inside grid sampling. so that it will remove outlier.
    - in the "register frame" the lidar point undergoes initialize frame without subsampling removal. then go grid sampling withoutlier removal.
    - we can change this vice versa if we think its not working.
    - build all slamming is working on target 7.
    - TODO: complete the slamming pipeline
    - for map, I have take a look many times and it is not possible to apply tbb parallel on it. until now we stay with tsl-robin.

    - I check the main.cpp from steam_icp
    - > options.odometry_options = SteamLioOdometry --line195
    - ROS2_PARAM_CLAUSE is initialize as my json file
    - auto &steam_icp_options = dynamic_cast<SteamLioOdometry::Options &>(odometry_options);
    - tsl::robin_map supports concurrent reads but not writes without synchronization
    - I have update map.hpp to potential a better and safer version.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mittwoch, 16. Juli 2025 09:41
    - add trajectory.hpp with brief comment
    - going back to Transformation understanding
    - Tworld,new‚Äã=Tworld,old‚Äã * Trelative, where Trelative define from LLA2NED and RPY of the compass.
    - LLA2NED, the NED is relative translation
    - I have been adviced to remove the global control on each of my tbb function especially in finalstateestimation. will do tomorrow.

    - I have double check the map.hpp until today there is not bug that I can found. expected map.hpp to works okay.
    - "Hey, if anyone ever asks for the string "SLAM_LIDAR_INERTIAL_ODOM", you should use the constructor for the lidarinertialodom class to create the object they want."
    - Phase 1: The Setup (Automatic Program Startup)
        - This phase prepares the system.
        - Registration: Inside the lidarinertialodom.hpp file, the SLAM_REGISTER_ODOMETRY macro creates a special static helper object.
        - Auto-Run: Because this object is static, its constructor (OdometryRegister()) runs automatically when the program launches.
        - Populate the "Menu": This constructor adds an entry to a central, hidden static map inside the Odometry class. The entry consists of:
        - The Key: The string "SLAM_LIDAR_INERTIAL_ODOM".
        - The Value: A "recipe" (a C++ lambda) for how to create a lidarinertialodom object.
    - At the end of this phase, the system knows that "SLAM_LIDAR_INERTIAL_ODOM" exists, but no lidarinertialodom object has actually been created yet.
    - Phase 2: The Action (When Get is Called)
        - This phase happens when your SLAMPipeline code runs.
        - The Request: Your code calls Odometry::Get("SLAM_LIDAR_INERTIAL_ODOM", json_path).
        - Lookup: The Get function looks up the string "SLAM_LIDAR_INERTIAL_ODOM" in the central map and finds the "recipe" that was registered in Phase 1.
        - Execution: The Get function executes the recipe, handing it the json_path string.
        - Creation: The recipe's only instruction is to call std::make_shared<lidarinertialodom>(json_path). This is the moment the lidarinertialodom object is finally constructed. Its constructor uses the json_path to load all its settings from the file.
        - Return: A pointer to the new, fully-configured lidarinertialodom object is returned to the SLAMPipeline.
    - learn about how virtual and override function work and use it in setInitialPose. polymorphism
    - the hash technique in voxel.hpp redefined
    - alot of bug identified. tomorrow I want to build inside target7 and potentially run with data. as the pipeline maybe finished.

    - lidar raw give measurement timestamp in nanosecond
    - in lidar decode we convert it into sec
    - in lidarinertialodometry.hpp, in intializetimestamp, the begin and end of the index of current frame is define from the lidar data which is timed in second.
    - there is a small detail where if traj::time take value in double, its know that is in second.
    - I need to check the locking mechanism in finalicp
    - between log and gt, there is time delay like 4 frame for gt. its okay.
    - alot of confussion because the of the transformation T_target_source(use by ROS) or T_source_target. I think I learn before is the old mehtod which use T_source_target.
    - so I will stay with T_target_source because modern method use that.
    - Cb2n function creates a matrix that transforms a vector from the body (robot) frame to the navigation (map) frame.
    - defines the pose of a sensor s in the world frame e (ENU) as T_es. T_target_source. target frame, source of point.
    - If the input LLA is the position of the robot, the output NED vector is the translation component of Tmr (T_map_robot). It represents the robot's position within the map frame.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - T_target_souce mean target is "change frame into" and source mean "change frame from". 
    - T_rm "change frame from map into robot". T_mr "change frame from robot into map".
    - TODO in initialized motion, the first frame should be initialized with Tmr
    - "registration summary" contain R_ms and t_ms
    - trajectory_ use T_ms // equivalent to T_mr
    - auto &current_estimate = trajectory_.at(index_frame); is a pointer to the trajectory_
    - which take current_estimate.begin_t = begin_T_ms.block<3, 1>(0, 3); // Begin translation
    - and current_estimate.begin_R = begin_T_ms.block<3, 3>(0, 0); // Begin rotation
    - Question! why use T_rm??
    - T_rm is part of TrajectoryVar
    - trajectory_vars_
        - Internal state for the optimizer. These are the variables the SLAM backend adjusts to find the best solution.
        - Continuous. It's a set of "knots" (pose, velocity, acceleration at specific times) that define a smooth, continuous trajectory.
        - Pointers to StateVar objects (SE3StateVar, VSpaceStateVar). These are nodes in the optimization graph.
        - Stores the pose of the robot in the map (Trm‚Äã).
        - It's the input to the optimization problem. The icp function builds a trajectory from these variables to solve for the best motion.
    - trajectory_
        - User-facing output. This is the final result of the odometry that other parts of a system would use.
        - Discrete. It's a sequence of Frame objects, each representing a distinct time interval (a single LiDAR scan).
        - Concrete values (Eigen::Matrix3d, Eigen::Vector3d) and the raw Point3D data for each frame.
        - Stores the pose of the sensor in the map (Tms‚Äã).
        - It's primarily the output of the system. Its values are derived from the final optimized trajectory_vars_.
    - SLAM_TRAJ
        - The Blueprint üìù. It's a mathematical model that defines how pose, velocity, and acceleration are related over time.
        - Local & Temporary. It is created at the beginning of each icp call and destroyed at the end.
        - Interpolation & Constraint Generation. Its main jobs are to provide interpolated poses at any time t and to generate the motion model cost terms that link the state variables together.
        - A set of mathematical equations describing a smooth curve.
    - sliding_window_filter_
        - The Problem Manager üèóÔ∏è. It holds the complete factor graph (all state variables and constraints) for the current window of frames.
        - Persistent & Global. It's a class member that lives for the entire duration of the odometry process, evolving as new frames are added and old ones are removed.
        - State & Constraint Management. Its main jobs are to addStateVariable, addCostTerm, and, crucially, to marginalizeVariable (remove old states while preserving their information).
        - A database that stores all the control points and rules that the final curve must adhere to.
        - initialize at lidar intertial odom and first called at icp line ~1966
    - Define the marginalization time based on delay_adding_points
        - const double marg_time = trajectory_.at(index_frame - options_.delay_adding_points - 1).end_timestamp;
    - I don't want to be so exited, but today, I know the problem due to marginalization. as I increase the delay point the program does not crash. 
    - I also don't want to give high hope but the rmse value is very low.
    - thats for today alhamdulillah!
    - there is an ill condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Freitag, 25. Juli 2025 12:12
    - paper idea: ""Performance Comparison of Single Merged LiDAR Factor versus Multiple Individual LiDAR Factors in LiDAR-Inertial Factor Graph Optimization for Marine Vehicle SLAM"  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    - I think I need to create the vizualization algo for my slam pipeline to check if the transformed Lidar data and the IMU is exactly as what I intend it todo.
    - the problem come from the optimization process.gauss newton GaussNewtonSolverNVA
    - I have been advice to isolate my cost term which maybe wrong.
    - testing remove the IMU factor to check convergence
    - removing the IMU factor create back the ill condition, thus I revoke changes and the icp iterate until iteration 9 before failling.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Montag, 4. August 2025 15:27
    - why no IMU factor
    - revert back to initial odom as identity
    - I will redo the lidar measurement to fixed as sensor measurement and not vehicle measurement.
    - Trajectory lidarinertialodom::trajectory() it calcualte T_ms
    - in update map also has transformation sensor to robot
    - at line 1915. TODO; to find the smoking gun on why no IMU data.

    - DONE check if vizualization from steam-icp using ros2 either only update point for every frame or update the whole map for every frame.
    - ANS - steam icp update the whole map each frame. idea, update periodically or update only when the vehicle move certain threshold.
    - TODO check transformation is correctly figured in lidar 
    - Practical Equivalence
    $ T_{\text{target} \leftarrow \text{source}} $: Most explicit, widely used in ROS tf and calibration literature (e.g., ‚Äú3D LIDAR-Camera Extrinsic Calibration Using an Arbitrary Trihedron‚Äù). Ideal for documentation and communication.
    $ T_{ts} $: Compact, common in code and transform naming (e.g., ROS transform frames like base_link_to_lidar). Less verbose but assumes context for direction.
    $ T^{\text{t}}_{\text{s}} $: Formal, used in mathematical papers and some robotics contexts. Slightly less common in software but clear in academic writing.

                    0 0 1‚Äã‚Äã
    Direct Explanation

    - T_rm: Denotes the transformation from map (m, source) to robot (r, target), i.e., $ T_{r \leftarrow m} $. Subscript order is target-source (r m).
    - w_mr_inr (and dw_mr_inr): Denotes the twist (velocity) of the robot (r, moving/target) relative to the map (m, fixed/source), expressed in the robot frame (in r). Subscript order is source-target (m r), with "inr" specifying the body-frame expression.
    - Significance: The flip ensures consistency with:

    - Pose composition: $ T_{r \leftarrow m} $ maps points from map to robot (chainable as left-multiplication).
    - Twist integration: $ {}^r \xi_{m \leftarrow r} $ integrates body-fixed motion (right-multiplication in exponentials).
    - Without the flip, notations would mismatch kinematic equations (e.g., $ \dot{T} = T \hat{\xi} $ for body twists), leading to error-prone code.
    - TODO finish change the notation and proceed for testing
